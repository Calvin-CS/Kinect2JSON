# Kinect2JSON readme

Kinect2JSON takes the body and handstate data from the kinect (both v1 and v2) and turns it into JSON, making it available both locally and on the computer's public IP through Websockets.

Currently, it only supports Windows 8/8.1.

The server listens on port 8181.

In order to install, just download the zip from the <a href="https://github.com/Calvin-CS/Kinect2JSON/releases" target="_blank">Releases</a> page, extract it, and run the setup.exe.

Make sure to plug in the Kinect v2 and let windows install the drivers before running Kinect2JSON.
