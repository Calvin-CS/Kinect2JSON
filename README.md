After downloading the files, go to your downloads and right-click on "server.zip" and click extract all, and then click extract in the bottom right. Do this for "samples.zip" if you downloaded it.

Next, go into the unzipped "server" folder. Open the "server" folder inside, and then click on setup.

A box will come up saying "Application Install - Security Warning". Click "Install".

Another window will come up saying "windows protected your PC". Click "more info", then click "run anyway".

A window will popup about "windows security alert". Check the box next to "public networks", then click "allow access".

Right-click on "load experimental extension". A file dialog box will pop up.

In the dialog box navigate to your downloads folder and choose KinectinScratch.
